## What took place?

Held at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), the camp kicked off with lectures and hands-on activities to build up the participantsâ€™ foundation in cybersecurity techniques. They learnt how to conduct security assessments of IT networks, perform network monitoring and analysis, and even mount cyber incident responses. As training was carried out in a highly-realistic simulated IT environment, they were able to understand and put the theories into practice effectively.
