#### Overview
#ProjectFOCZOmni is my dedicated home lab environment, developed to simulate and showcases how I build and manage a small-scale IT environment for personal and professional growth. It enables me to explore, learn, and innovate.

The homelab also serves as a testing ground me to do Proof-of-Concept before turning ideas into reality.

### .Goals
- **Self Learning**: Experiment with new technologies and enhance my skills in networking, system administration, and DevOps.  
- **Professional Development**: Host personal projects and explore virtualisation, containerisation, and integration with cloud technologies.  
- **Sharing and Exchange**: Provide and exchange insights and inspiration for others interested in building their own home lab.

### Security and Infrastructure

- **Domain Names I own**:  
  - conanzhang.tech (Purchased from Namecheap)
  - ztcc.ink (Purchased from Namecheap)

- **Information Security Profile**:  
  - Cloudflare for DNS Management
