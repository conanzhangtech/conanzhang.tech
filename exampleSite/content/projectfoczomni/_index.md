> **A personal playground for experimentation and innovation.**

#### Overview
#ProjectFOCZOmni is my dedicated home lab environment, developed to simulate and showcases how I build and manage a small-scale IT environment for personal and professional growth. It enables me to explore, learn, and innovate.

**The lab also serves as a testing ground me to do Proof-of-Concept before turning ideas into reality.**
