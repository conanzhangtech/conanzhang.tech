> **A personal playground for experimentation and innovation.**

#### Overview
#ProjectFOCZOmni is my dedicated home lab environment, developed to simulate real-world infrastructure and test technologies. It enables me to explore, learn, and innovate by building a controlled environment for deploying and managing different systems. 

**The lab also serves as a testing ground me to do Proof-of-Concept before turning ideas into reality.**

The following is a high-level overview of my infrastructure:

- __**Virtualised Infrastructure:**__

Powered by VMware ESXi and managed by vSphere, it allows me to seamlessly create, manage and virtualise servers and services.

- __**Comprehensive Networking:**__

A virtual Switch forms the backbone of my network, allowing me to have more control.

- **Firewall and Security:**
  pfSense acts as the dedicated firewall, providing advanced threat protection, traffic shaping, and VPN capabilities. Nessus is employed for vulnerability assessment, ensuring the lab remains secure from potential exploits.

- **Automation and Orchestration:**
  Tools like Ansible streamline configuration management and automated deployments, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual overhead.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  Grafana and Zabbix deliver real-time monitoring and logging, offering insights into system performance and availability.

- **Cloud Integration:**
  Azure Cloud extends the capabilities of the lab, enabling hybrid cloud experiments and scalability testing.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - **Virtualization:** VMware ESXi, vCenter Server Appliance (vSphere), Proxmox
  - **Networking:** Cisco Switch
  - **Firewall & Security:** pfSense, Nessus
  - **Automation & Monitoring:** Ansible, Grafana, Zabbix
  - **Cloud:** Azure Cloud
