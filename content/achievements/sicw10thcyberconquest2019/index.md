## What took place?

Each team, comprising two students, took on Red and Blue team-type challenges. The red team member had to discover and penetrate network services while the blue team member monitored network traffic and analysed packet logs.

Students were tested on cybersecurity domains such as penetration testing, security operations and cryptography as they raced against time to accumulate as many points as possible by completing tasks and obtaining answers known as “flags”.
